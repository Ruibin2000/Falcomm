# Spark Quick Commands

Updated: 2026-10-07. Use this guide on the installed Spark testbed. For a new host, see [Software and Drivers](software_installation_and_drivers.md); for detailed configuration, see the [Full Reproduction Runbook](full_reproduction_runbook.md). UE commands are in [UE Laptop Quick Commands](ue_laptop_quick_commands.md). Use Bash, run one step at a time, and stop at any `FAIL` result.

Verified on 2026-10-07: **DU E2 Setup, all five actual UE KPM measurements, the repaired report-time display, normal subscription deletion, and successful xApp exit**. Earlier UE ID `2` had `report_age_us` values of **499–717 µs**; the latest repeat with UE ID `7` had **591–796 µs**. The current DU configuration uses TX **70** / RX **40**; the 2026-10-05 UE application traffic / TCP result used TX **80** / RX **40**. Keep these RF baselines distinct. The commands below read the current configuration without changing gains.

Versions: OCUDU `050a2bb`; FlexRIC `73650812`, build directory `build-ocudu`, GCC 13.3 / Debug / `E2AP_V3` / `KPM_V3_00` / `NONE_XAPP` / `XAPP_MULTILANGUAGE=OFF`.

Run checks in a diagnostics terminal. CU, FlexRIC, DU, and iperf each need their own foreground terminal. Use the same xApp Bash terminal for steps 6 and 7; shell variables are not shared between terminals.

## 0 Check the SIM and subscriber plan

The new Open Cells cards OC011830 / IMSI `001010000000101` and OC011831 / IMSI `001010000000102` are provisioned, Milenage-authenticated, and verified as ready in Quectel modems. They have **not yet registered with the RAN/Open5GS**. The earlier baseline IMSI `001010000000001` and its single-DU/KPM results remain separate.

Before using either new card, prepare its own matching core subscriber from protected `~/sim_du1_credentials.txt` or `~/sim_du2_credentials.txt`, SST 1, `internet`, and IPv4 type 1. Keep K/OPc private. The programming tool's recommended SQN reference `96` requires verification of the installed core's representation/current state; do not blindly insert or reset decimal 96. See [SIM assignments](sim_provisioning_and_dual_ue.md#sim-assignments) and [Open5GS preparation](sim_provisioning_and_dual_ue.md#prepare-open5gs-subscribers).

These launch commands cover **DU1 only**. DU2's configuration, radio serial, PCI/SSB, and distinct DU/network identifiers and addresses are not supplied. IMSI does not automatically bind a UE to a DU; the DU1 lock cannot serve as a DU2 template. Two registered WWAN/IP paths and MPTCP remain pending; see [dual-UE validation](sim_provisioning_and_dual_ue.md#validate-two-ue-paths).

## 1 Check before startup

Run in the Spark diagnostics terminal. **Run UHD checks only while DU is stopped.** If an earlier DU/CU experiment is still running, follow the shutdown steps first.

```bash
if pgrep -x odu >/dev/null; then
  printf 'FAIL: DU is running; stop it before probing B210\n'
else
  lsusb -t
  sudo uhd_find_devices
fi
```

Confirm B210 serial `3271233` and `5000M` in the USB tree.

```bash
cd /home/nyu/ocudu
rg 'tx_gain|rx_gain|srate|dl_arfcn|channel_bandwidth_MHz' configs/du1_b210_n78_20mhz.yml
```

Expect TX 70, RX 40, 23.04 MS/s, ARFCN 650000, and 20 MHz. The UE cell lock uses SSB ARFCN **649632**.

## 2 Restore performance settings after reboot

```bash
cd /home/nyu/ocudu
sudo ./scripts/ocudu_performance
```

Answer `Y` to each of the three prompts, then check the short summaries:

```bash
awk '$0 != "performance" {bad++} END {printf "CPU governor: %s (%d CPUs)\n", NR && !bad ? "OK" : "FAIL", NR}' /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
if [ "$(sudo cat /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll)" = N ]; then
  printf 'DRM polling: OK\n'
else
  printf 'DRM polling: FAIL\n'
fi
sysctl -n net.core.rmem_max net.core.wmem_max net.core.rmem_default net.core.wmem_default |
  awk '$0 != 33554432 {bad++} END {print "Network buffers: " (NR == 4 && !bad ? "OK" : "FAIL")}'
```

## 3 Start MongoDB and the core

Preserve the existing `open5gs-mongo` container and data volume. The baseline subscriber `001010000000001` should have SST 1, session `internet`, and type 1; see the [subscriber check](full_reproduction_runbook.md#5-start-mongodb-and-verify-the-subscriber). When using the new cards, run the separate nonsecret [two-subscriber preflight](full_reproduction_runbook.md#5a-prepare-the-two-provisioned-open-cells-subscribers) after MongoDB is ready. That check is a reproduction procedure and cannot prove K/OPc or SQN correctness.

```bash
sudo docker start open5gs-mongo >/dev/null &&
sudo docker exec open5gs-mongo mongosh --quiet --eval '
const r = db.adminCommand({ping: 1});
if (r.ok !== 1) { print("MongoDB: FAIL"); quit(1); }
print("MongoDB: OK");
'
```

On this dedicated Spark, stop the installed LTE/optional services first. Omit absent units on another host:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop open5gs-mmed open5gs-hssd open5gs-pcrfd open5gs-sgwcd open5gs-sgwud
sudo systemctl stop open5gs-bsfd open5gs-seppd
```

Start the ten SA units sequentially, then check each one and list only failures. A single `is-active --quiet` call with multiple units cannot prove that all are active.

```bash
CORE_UNITS=(open5gs-nrfd open5gs-scpd open5gs-udrd open5gs-udmd open5gs-ausfd open5gs-pcfd open5gs-nssfd open5gs-upfd open5gs-smfd open5gs-amfd)
for unit in "${CORE_UNITS[@]}"; do
  if ! sudo systemctl start "$unit"; then
    printf 'FAIL: Cannot start %s\n' "$unit"
    break
  fi
done
active=0
for unit in "${CORE_UNITS[@]}"; do
  if systemctl is-active --quiet "$unit"; then
    active=$((active + 1))
  else
    printf 'FAIL: %s (%s)\n' "$unit" "$(systemctl is-active "$unit")"
  fi
done
printf '5GC active: %d/10\n' "$active"
```

Check the existing `ogstun` for its UP flag, MTU 1400, address, and private route:

```bash
if ip -o link show dev ogstun | awk '/(<|,)UP(,|>)/ && / mtu 1400 / {ok=1} END {exit !ok}' &&
   ip -o -4 addr show dev ogstun | awk '$4 == "10.45.0.1/16" {ok=1} END {exit !ok}' &&
   ip -4 route show 10.45.0.0/16 | awk '/^10\.45\.0\.0\/16 .*dev ogstun/ {ok=1} END {exit !ok}'; then
  printf 'ogstun: OK (UP, MTU 1400, 10.45.0.1/16, route)\n'
else
  printf 'ogstun: FAIL; check networkd and the 99-open5gs configuration\n'
fi
```

## 4 Start CU and FlexRIC in foreground terminals

**CU terminal:**

```bash
cd /home/nyu/ocudu
sudo build/apps/cu/ocu -c configs/cu.yml
```

Confirm N2 `completed` and `==== CU started ===`; keep CU running. Start FlexRIC in its own terminal and save the current log:

```bash
set -o pipefail
stdbuf -oL -eL /usr/local/bin/flexric/ric/nearRT-RIC -c /usr/local/etc/flexric/ric.conf 2>&1 |
  tee /tmp/flexric-ric.log
```

## 5 Start DU with E2 enabled

The existing `configs/du1_flexric.yml` enables DU1 E2/KPM and metrics. If it is missing, create it using the [full runbook](full_reproduction_runbook.md) first. Run in the **DU terminal**; this starts B210 RF transmission:

```bash
cd /home/nyu/ocudu
sudo build/apps/du_split_8/odu \
  -c configs/du1_b210_n78_20mhz.yml \
  -c configs/du1_flexric.yml
```

Confirm F1-C / E2AP `completed` and `==== DU started ===` for this DU1 baseline. A future second DU requires its own reviewed configuration and per-DU evidence; the summary below proves only the current single-DU connections. FlexRIC should receive this DU's `E2 SETUP-REQUEST` and accept KPM ID `2`. In the diagnostics terminal, check the summary of the three SCTP connections:

```bash
sudo ss -H -an -A sctp | awk '
  /ESTAB/ && /:38412([[:space:]]|$)/ {n2=1}
  /ESTAB/ && /:38472([[:space:]]|$)/ {f1=1}
  /ESTAB/ && /:36421([[:space:]]|$)/ {e2=1}
  END {
    printf "SCTP: N2=%s F1=%s E2=%s\n", n2 ? "OK" : "FAIL", f1 ? "OK" : "FAIL", e2 ? "OK" : "FAIL"
    exit !(n2 && f1 && e2)
  }'
if [ ! -f /tmp/flexric-ric.log ]; then
  printf 'RIC log was not saved; confirm acceptance of KPM ID 2 in the running RIC terminal.\n'
elif grep -q 'Accepting RAN function ID 2 with def = ORAN-E2SM-KPM' /tmp/flexric-ric.log; then
  printf 'RIC accepted DU KPM: OK\n'
else
  printf 'RIC accepted DU KPM: FAIL; inspect the current FlexRIC log\n'
fi
```

Step 4 creates `/tmp/flexric-ric.log` through `tee`. An earlier direct RIC launch did not create this file. Inspect the running RIC terminal instead; saving a log does not require restarting the connection.

## 6 Verify the KPM subscription

**After this DU is accepted, run the entire block below in the Spark xApp terminal.** The example collects for about 10 seconds, then deletes the subscription and exits. Full output goes into a temporary log; a normal run prints one summary line. `KPM_LOG` exists only in this Bash terminal, so run the step 7 log commands here too. Earlier direct xApp launches without output redirection did not create this log file.

```bash
KPM_LOG=$(mktemp /tmp/flexric-kpm.XXXXXX.log)
/usr/local/bin/flexric/xApp/c/xapp_oran_moni \
  -c /usr/local/etc/flexric/xapp_oran_sm.conf >"$KPM_LOG" 2>&1
KPM_EXIT=$?
if [ "$KPM_EXIT" -eq 0 ] &&
   grep -q 'Successfully subscribed to RAN_FUNC_ID 2' "$KPM_LOG" &&
   grep -q 'E42 SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE rx' "$KPM_LOG" &&
   grep -q 'Test xApp run SUCCESSFULLY' "$KPM_LOG"; then
  printf 'KPM: OK (subscription, deletion, exit); log=%s\n' "$KPM_LOG"
else
  printf 'KPM: FAIL (exit=%s); log=%s\n' "$KPM_EXIT" "$KPM_LOG"
  tail -n 30 "$KPM_LOG"
fi
```

Subscription can succeed without UE measurements. The `OK` result above confirms the subscription lifecycle, not UE KPM reception.

## 7 Validate UE traffic and KPM reports

An earlier run received all five DU measurements for UE `gnb_cu_ue_f1ap=14`. After the timestamp repair, reception passed with UE ID `2`, then with UE ID `7` in the latest repeat. The following procedure coordinates application traffic and collection; its 30-second TCP test is a procedure, not a recorded benchmark result.

After UE registration, an IPv4 bearer, WWAN configuration, and ping succeed, start the server in the Spark **iperf terminal**:

```bash
iperf3 -s -B 10.45.0.1
```

After the UE laptop starts its 30-second TCP transfer, immediately run the entire step 6 block in the Spark **xApp terminal** so the roughly 10-second collection window overlaps UE traffic. After xApp exits, **stay in the same xApp terminal** to inspect the measurements:

```bash
if [ -n "${KPM_LOG:-}" ] && [ -f "$KPM_LOG" ]; then
  grep -E 'UE ID type|^DRB\.|^RRU\.' "$KPM_LOG" | tail -n 20
else
  printf 'KPM log is unset or missing; first run the entire step 6 block in this terminal.\n'
fi
```

If you switch terminals, first run `read -r -p 'Paste the full file path printed after log= in step 6: ' KPM_LOG` to select that capture's log, then run the check above. Do not guess an old log filename.

Require a UE ID and values for all five DU measurements before recording reception as successful. Empty output, `noValue`, or subscription success alone cannot prove that actual UE measurements arrived.

An xApp without the timestamp patch displays an invalid `KPM-v3 ind_msg latency`; the normal measurement summary excludes this line. The current source, installation, and actual UE `report_age_us` display have passed verification. Use the next step for repeat checks.

### 7a Verify reports after the timestamp repair

On 2026-10-07, an earlier run after installation received **12 reports** for UE ID `2`, with `report_age_us` of **499–717 µs**. The latest repeat received **12 reports** for UE ID `7`, with **591–796 µs**. Both completed subscription, deletion, and xApp exit successfully. An intervening run subscribed successfully but received no UE reports. **CU, DU, and RIC do not need a restart.** Wait for any existing xApp to exit, then repeat the check in this order.

1. Start the server in the Spark **iperf terminal**; skip this if it is already running:

```bash
iperf3 -s -B 10.45.0.1
```

2. In the UE laptop's Bash terminal where WWAN was configured, start a 30-second uplink transfer:

```bash
iperf3 -c 10.45.0.1 -B "${UE_IP:?Use the terminal where WWAN was configured}" -t 30 -i 0
```

3. Immediately after UE traffic starts, run the entire block below in the Spark **xApp terminal** so its roughly 10-second collection window overlaps the transfer. This creates a new log and does not depend on `KPM_LOG` from an earlier terminal:

```bash
KPM_LOG=$(mktemp /tmp/flexric-kpm.XXXXXX.log)
if /usr/local/bin/flexric/xApp/c/xapp_oran_moni \
  -c /usr/local/etc/flexric/xapp_oran_sm.conf >"$KPM_LOG" 2>&1; then
  KPM_EXIT=0
else
  KPM_EXIT=$?
fi
if [ "$KPM_EXIT" -eq 0 ] &&
   grep -q 'Successfully subscribed to RAN_FUNC_ID 2' "$KPM_LOG" &&
   grep -q 'E42 SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE rx' "$KPM_LOG" &&
   grep -q 'Test xApp run SUCCESSFULLY' "$KPM_LOG"; then
  KPM_REPORTS=$(awk '/^KPM-v3 report_age_us/ {n++} END {print n+0}' "$KPM_LOG")
  KPM_UES=$(awk '/^UE ID type = gNB-DU/ {n++} END {print n+0}' "$KPM_LOG")
  if [ "$KPM_REPORTS" -gt 0 ] && [ "$KPM_UES" -gt 0 ]; then
    printf 'KPM: OK (subscription, deletion, exit); UE reports=%s; log=%s\n' "$KPM_REPORTS" "$KPM_LOG"
    grep -E 'report_age_us|UE ID type' "$KPM_LOG" | tail -n 15
  else
    printf 'KPM: OK (subscription, deletion, exit); NO_UE (no UE reports in this run); log=%s\n' "$KPM_LOG"
    printf 'Confirm UE registration and overlap between traffic and collection.\n'
  fi
else
  printf 'KPM: FAIL (exit=%s; lifecycle checks failed); log=%s\n' "$KPM_EXIT" "$KPM_LOG"
  tail -n 30 "$KPM_LOG"
fi
```

A positive `UE reports` count confirms UE reports arrived in this run. `NO_UE` means subscription, deletion, and exit succeeded but no UE report arrived; check UE registration and traffic overlap. It does not establish a timestamp-repair failure. The printed path contains the full log; use step 7 in the same terminal to inspect the five measurements.

`report_age_us` is in microseconds and includes report processing, queuing, and forwarding time. It is not pure network delay or application RTT. A 30-second application uplink/downlink benchmark, report-period accuracy, and sustained stability remain to be verified. For the cause and accuracy limits, see the [Timestamp Repair Record](troubleshooting/2026-10-07_flexric_latency_fix.md).

If the repair needs reinstalling later, run the following in a Spark terminal and enter the sudo password. The script backs up and atomically replaces the KPM library and two C monitors:

```bash
sudo bash /home/nyu/Desktop/Falcon_repo/Falcon/scripts/flexric/install_timestamp_fix.sh
```

## 8 Shut down

1. Stop iperf, video, and other applications on both hosts. Let the finite xApp delete its subscription and exit normally.
2. Disconnect the UE laptop's bearer and remove this run's manual WWAN address and private host route; see [UE Shutdown](ue_laptop_quick_commands.md).
3. Press **`Ctrl+C` in the DU terminal**. Wait for `Stopping...` and the shell prompt; confirm DU has exited before stopping FlexRIC and CU.
4. Press **`Ctrl+C` in the FlexRIC terminal**, then **`Ctrl+C` in the CU terminal**.
5. Stop the ten core services in reverse order in the diagnostics terminal. WebUI/MongoDB may remain running.

```bash
CORE_UNITS=(open5gs-nrfd open5gs-scpd open5gs-udrd open5gs-udmd open5gs-ausfd open5gs-pcfd open5gs-nssfd open5gs-upfd open5gs-smfd open5gs-amfd)
for unit in open5gs-amfd open5gs-smfd open5gs-upfd open5gs-nssfd open5gs-pcfd open5gs-ausfd open5gs-udmd open5gs-udrd open5gs-scpd open5gs-nrfd; do
  sudo systemctl stop "$unit" || break
done
remaining=0
if pgrep -a -x 'odu|nearRT-RIC|ocu|xapp_oran_moni'; then
  printf 'FAIL: The processes above are still running\n'
  remaining=1
fi
for unit in "${CORE_UNITS[@]}"; do
  if systemctl is-active --quiet "$unit"; then
    printf 'FAIL: %s is still active\n' "$unit"
    remaining=1
  fi
done
[ "$remaining" -ne 0 ] || printf 'Stopped: DU / RIC / CU / xApp / 10 core units\n'
```

For a full shutdown, finish with `sudo docker stop open5gs-mongo` and `sudo systemctl stop open5gs-webui` if that unit is installed. Do not delete containers or volumes. Expand the current logs only after a failure, replacing the unit below with the failed service:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u open5gs-amfd --since '5 minutes ago' --no-pager -n 30
sudo grep -Ei 'E2|subscription|decode|error|failure' /tmp/du.log | tail -n 30
tail -n 30 /tmp/flexric-ric.log
```

For RF errors and USB issues, follow the [full runbook](full_reproduction_runbook.md#9-confirm-rf-and-start-the-du); do not probe B210 while DU is running. The old FlexRIC `1a3903a7` failed the Format 4 subscription in this test. Use the verified `73650812` build and matching libraries.
